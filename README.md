## Moringa School Phase 1 Data Science Project

### Overview
This project explores aviation accident data to uncover trends and provide insights on the frequency and patterns of aviation accidents over time.

### Business Understanding
- *Stakeholder*: The aviation safety board, government authorities, and airline companies.
- *Key Questions*:
  - How have aviation accidents changed over the years?
  - Are certain years or periods riskier than others?
  - What actions could be recommended based on observed trends?

### Data Understanding and Analysis
- *Source*: Aviation Data CSV provided in class.
- *Description*: The dataset contains records of aviation accidents with details such as date, aircraft type, location, and accident type.

### Visualizations
1. *Bar Chart* – Aviation accidents per year.
2. *Line Chart* – Trend of aviation accidents over time.
3. *Optional* – Additional visual(s) depending on exploration (e.g., accidents by state or aircraft type).

### Conclusion
- Accidents peaked during certain historical periods possibly due to regulatory, technological, or operational changes.
- A clear downward trend indicates improvements in aviation safety.
- Recommendations include focusing on newer technologies and strict safety regulations.
