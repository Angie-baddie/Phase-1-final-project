# Phase 1 Final Project: Aviation Accidents Analysis

## Overview
This project explores patterns and trends in aviation accidents using historical data. The goal is to uncover key insights that can help understand what factors may contribute to accident frequency and severity.

## Business Understanding
The main objective of this analysis is to provide stakeholders in aviation safety with a clearer picture of accident occurrences over time. Key questions include:
- How have aviation accidents changed over the years?
- Which states or aircraft types have the most recorded accidents?
- Are there any noticeable seasonal or geographic patterns?

## Data Understanding and Analysis
The data was sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). It includes over 80,000 aviation incidents with various attributes such as aircraft type, location, date, and number of injuries or fatalities.

Using Python and Pandas, the dataset was cleaned and filtered to focus on the most relevant variables. Visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Tableau to explore accident trends per year, state, and aircraft category.

Here are three key visualizations:
1. *Number of Accidents Per Year* – showing the overall trend.
2. *Accidents by State* – highlighting top states with most accidents.
3. *Aircraft Category Analysis* – comparing accident counts across aircraft types.

## Conclusion
- The number of aviation accidents peaked in the 1980s and has declined over time.
- States like California and Texas have had the most recorded accidents, likely due to air traffic volume.
- Single-engine aircraft were involved in a large portion of incidents.

These findings can help safety authorities prioritize inspection resources and policy changes.
